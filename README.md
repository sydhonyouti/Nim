# Nim
Nim is a mathematical game that practices the uses the networking protocol. It uses the UDP protocols to communicate between the client and server.

To test the game out locally:
- Download the file 
- Look for the Nim.sln, which should pop up the file in your working IDE that supports C/C++
- Once you run the program from the IDE, there will be a .exe file inside the project file
- This acts like the server and the one running from the IDE acts like a client
